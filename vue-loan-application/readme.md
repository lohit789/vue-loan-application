Assignment Brief: Build a web page for getting loan request from a customer:

Loan Amount: 25000 to 100000

Tenure: 1 - 24 months

(The above two fields can be aesthetically styled so that the customer experience is good)

 

Once customer enters the value, the data is sent to a back end that maintains a interest range mapping as below:

 

25000 - 50000 

if tenure is 1-6 months - 1%

if tenure is 6-12 months - 1.5%  

if tenure is 12-18 months - 2%  

if tenure is 18-24 months - 2.5%  

 

50000 - 75000 

if tenure is 1-6 months - 0.5%

if tenure is 6-12 months - 1%  

if tenure is 12-18 months - 1.5%  

if tenure is 18-24 months - 2%  

 

75000 - 100000 

if tenure is 1-6 months - 0.3%

if tenure is 6-12 months - 0.8%  

if tenure is 12-18 months - 1%  

if tenure is 18-24 months - 1.2%
